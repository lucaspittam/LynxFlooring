    "description": "Many consolidators in the industry focus on quick growth in anticipation of an eventual exit, however, we acquire contractors to hold indefinitely. We do not buy companies with the sole purpose of flipping them in few years, nor do we try to rebuild the businesses. Instead, our strategy is to patiently build-on existing strengths to grow our companies into resilient and scalable contractors, ready to withstand the ever-evolving future.\n\nThe philosophy behind Lynx Flooring comes from its parent company, Lynx Equity Ltd, a buy-and-hold investment firm focused on acquiring small-medium sized businesses in diverse industries. With over 60 acquisitions across United States, Canada, UK & Europe, Lynx Equity is one of the largest investment firms in the space and employs a unique approach in building partnerships for long-term sustainable growth.",
